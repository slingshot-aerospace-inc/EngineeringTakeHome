# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Getting the app running

First, make sure you have Node version X or later.

Then, run the following command to get the app up and running:

`npm install && npm run start`

You should see the following screen:

INSERT SCREENSHOT OF WORKING APP

Fantastic! Now, on to the take-home test!

## Take Home Test

For the FE test, we will be evaluating your ability to take a lo-fi screen and
make serviceable prototype. Don't spend more than an hour or so on this, but be
prepared to talk about your code.

We don't expect this to be production ready, we want to respect your time and this
is just our way of getting to see how you think and code without the pressure of
an incredibly stressful in-person pairing evaluation. So, please be prudent with
your time, we are excited to talk about this with you!

To make this a little more fun, here is a silly scenario to get you started... :)

## Scenario

It’s Thursday and you are packing up your bags to head off to your favorite bar, “La Chancla”, with some friends from college when you hear someone burst into the office.

There stands your brilliant UX designer, Harry. Glasses crooked, hair wild, his hands look like he was attacked by a gang of sharpies.

“Oh good, I caught you in time!I totally forgot that we have an investor meeting Monday morning and I was hoping you could whip up some prototypes for me. Considering you are kind of a Big Deal™ around here, I’m sure you’ll get it done in no time!”

Although his attempts at flattery are pathetic, judging by the coffee stains on his pants, you decide La Chancla will have to wait. Also, you are kind of a Big Deal™.

“Fine, but you’re getting the first round at La Chancla”, you say, pulling out your Space Gray MacBook Pro.

Relief floods the room as Harry eagerly rushes to your side and shows you the mocks.

“They are really rough for now, so don’t worry about them being pixel perfect, I need more of the big picture stuff done.”

You give him your best, “I got this, go take a nap you look really tired” look, but it’s kind of a hard expression to communicate in one look.

“Don’t worry Harry, I’ll be done in no time”.

You crack your knuckles, plug in your laptop and get to work...

> Note, Harry’s Mocks are incomplete, if something is incomplete from his mocks, make an assumption!

[Here](./ui_mocks.png) are the mocks!
